# Blockchain Foundations

Note: these are just my notes for the program - no guarantee of accuracy or validity of notes here - just a brain dump.

## Introductions

Review working groups and communities of interest for GBA.

## Global Government Blockchain Initiatives

* Estonia
* Honduras - land titling
* Georgia - land titling
* Dubai - Biz processes on blockchain

## History of Blockchain & Overfiew

* 2008 - Satoshi launches after too big to fail.
* Shared Record Book / ledger of anything
* Initially rose, and usage falling
* Coinmarketcap
* Ecosystem - fintech, exchanges, associations, apps, mining, nes, wallets, etc
* Private Spending: '13 - 80MM, '15 - 475MM, '17 - 4,500MM

## Blockchain Tech Specs

Blockchain tech overview - cursory

## Governemnt

### Asset management pilot projects - Contracted vendor to develop a prototype using blockchain or DLT to streamline difficule reconciliation operations that are involved in many financial operatios

Example:  Track and manage certain physical assets such as computers and cell phones.

### CyberSecurity: Going from centralization and control to openness and consensus

    New paradigm lets everyone see it - validate and confirm it is true

    How do you prove that DC is the capital of the US - you don't have to because it is general knowledge (blockchain provides general consensu on nearly anything)

FISMA - Federal Information Security Management Act

Most PKI digital signatures use Certificate Authorities to issue, revoke and store key pairs - risk is hackable centralized signatures and take entire system's information. Identity spoofing to gain access

DHS rewarded 9.7MM to 13 small biz innovation research projects

US Senate NDAA 2018 requires blockchain cyber

Now, if gov't agency saves money using blokchain they can keep it in their own budget instead of just losing the unspend money


### Defense

* complex supplier network w/ millions of components
* 3d prints parts, allows vulnerabilities in supply chain, 3D printing military parts
* Designs can be hacked - insert flaws into parts
* Blockchain can help verify the designs

Communications

* Verify integrity of data feeds and communications

## Economic Analysis

* Traditionally require reporting, tax returns for data gathering
* Blockchain allows real-time data gathering
* EthViewer.live

* Some nations are creating their own national coin: Venezuela, Russia, Japan (olympics), Dubai

### Innovation

* U.S. Lags, China , Global, and Europe leading (switzerland)
* Gov't tax by printing more money
* Use blockchain for congress to appropriate smart contracts

### Education 

* Increase education globally - credentials & fraud


### Healthcare

* Data access
* Care coordination
* Control of own data / data passport
* Invert system of control from central insurance/gov to individual mgmt of own records

### Identity Management

* Applicable to ALL use cases
* Applies to Individuals and Organizations
* Identity vs Persona
* UGC is collected by companies and sold 
*  Hosting ID on blockchain gives users power over data access
*  Greater transparency in collection and use of personal data

What makes up your identity

* Birth Cert
* SS Card
* Biometrics - heart rate markers as ID
* ID management
* Location history
* Data profile
* Family Tree
* Financial Records

### Social Program Oversight

* Smart contracts allow funds to be distributedand used based on predefined 

### Supply Chain / Logistics

* Cyber Supply Chain
* Bring data from supply chain to all parties involved
* VP supply chain wal mart
* Mango example from Wal-Mart ("where we got this from and when we got it") Need to call down the chain through disparate systems


## Blockchain Architecture - Encryption and Security

* Encryption scrambles data 
* Generates cypher text and needs keys to be decrypted

Non-Repudiation

* Cannot deny that a transaction is performed
*  Prevent unauthorized use or misuse of credentials
* Someone allows access codes to cards , hard to determine who actually used them to access secured locations


* POW overview
